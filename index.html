								<h2>Stored-program concept</h2>
								<em>1940s</em>
								<p>									
									The key to the modern general-purpose digital computer is something called the stored-program concept. This is the idea that the computer’s instructions for manipulating the data (aka the “program”) can be stored within the computer’s memory itself. In other words, to the computer, the data, and the instructions for manipulating the data are formally equivalent. This idea is widely credited to John Von Neumann (There is a lot of debate on whether Alan Turing should be the one to be recognised for this idea), who introduced it in a famous report called <a href="http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/other/sts.035/www/PDFs/edvac.pdf" target="_blank">“First draft of a report on the EDVAC”</a> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDVAC" target="_blank">EDVAC</a> being the successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, widely considered to be the first digital computer) This <a href="http://blog.castac.org/2015/03/how-influential-was-turing/" target="_blank">idea</a> is central to what a software system is.

									In this period of time SSE was still in its infancy as the resources required to research this topic were not easily available however this slowly began to change with the arrival of UNIX. 
								</p>
							</li>
							<li data-date="01/01/1960">
								<h2>Arrival of UNIX</h2>
								<em>1960-80s</em>
								<p>
									The history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were jointly developing an experimental time sharingoperating system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics" target="_blank">Multics</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE-600_series" target="_blank">GE-645mainframe</a>. Bell labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics then developed a simplified system called UNIX by Dennis Ritchie. If you would like to know how UNIX works click on the following <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/682/how-does-a-unix-or-linux-system-work" target="_blank">link</a>. 
								</p>
								<p>
									"...the number of UNIX installations has grown to 10, with more expected..."
								</p>
								<p>
								<cite>
									- Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, June 1972
								</cite>
								</p>
								<p>
									Now UNIX is used by Apple as its main OS for their Mac product. 
								</p>
							</li>

								<h2>Modern World</h2>
								<em>1980-now</em>
								<p>	
									Microsoft developed windows which was initially a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) for MS-DOS and a competitor to Macintosh. If you want to see what MS-DOS was search up “cmd” on a windows system. Microsoft has updated their initial command-line prompt into more user friendly features and windows has dominated operating systems. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Now, there are many institutions who offer specialised masters programs about SSE.  Ranging from Carnegie Mellon to UCL, each focuses on different or similar areas of research. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The areas of research range from cloud-based computing systems to mobile systems, and the scope is as large as consumer/industry needs are.

        						<p class="impact">Software systems engineering has a profound impact and significant implications on almost all aspects of computer science and technology systems in general. Some of the most notable applications of software systems engineering research include the development of operating systems, embedded systems, expert systems, database management systems, and content management systems.<a>[1]</a> So what are the real-world uses and implications of these systems? </p>
							</li>				
       						<li class="col-md-12 animate-box">
       							<p class="impact">Operating systems are essentially the software that contains the fundamental files that a computer or other electronic device needs in order to boot up. Operating systems are also responsible for communicating with hardware and software components and allocating the resources to different programs or software processes that allows them to run. Additionally, most operating systems provide a graphical user interface that includes a desktop and the ability to manage files and folders and install and run programs.<a>[2]</a> Some popular examples of operating systems are Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Since they provide a device with the necessary files to boot up, operating systems are what give a device basic functionality, and computers, tablets, phones, and numerous other electronic devices would not cease to function without them.</p>
       							<p class="impact">Embedded systems are computer systems that consist of a combination of hardware and software components which are specifically designed to perform one or more functions within a larger, more complex system.<a>[3]</a> Embedded systems are used by multiple industries and are involved in a multitude of the electrical devices that we use daily. Embedded systems are used in phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, and printers and are used by telecommunication systems for telephones and wifi routers. Additionally, they are also used in transportation for multiple purposes including locomotives for trains, automobiles, and planes. Embedded systems even play an important role in medicine, as they are used in medical devices, such as defibrillators and automated insulin pumps.<a>[4]</a> </p>       							
       							<p class="impact">Expert systems, which are one of the types of artificial intelligence software, are computer applications that are designed to emulate the decision-making processes and capabilities of human experts within a particular field in order to solve complex problems within that specific domain.<a>[5]</a> Expert systems can be divided into several different categories based on the particular type of decision-making that the application is intended to perform, and therefore, due to this variety, have a wide range of possible uses and real-life applications. For example, expert systems can be used in medicine as a diagnosis system. The financial and commercial sector can also utilize expert systems as a tool for the detection of possible fraud and suspicious transactions among other things.<a>[6]</a></p>
       							<p class="impact">Database management systems are a type of software whose purpose is to enable a user to create and manage databases, which are basically structured sets of data, by allowing them to store, modify, and retrieve data stored within the database. Due to their fundamental role in keeping and managing databases, database management systems are crucial to multiple technologies, including flight reservation systems and automated teller machines (ATMs). <a>[7]</a></p>
       							<p class="impact">Content management systems are a type of software application that is used to allow and support the creation, modification, and management of digital content.<a>[8]</a> Content management systems are very useful as they can support cooperation by multiple users on digital content in a collaborative environment with different permission levels that determine the ways in which different users can interact with the content while at the same time providing some form of version control in order to manage any changes made.<a>[9]</a> One of the most popular examples of content management systems is Wordpress. </p>

The future of software engineering truly lies in the types of creations that take place between now and the next 50 years. These can impact the digital world on the massive scale and allow us to lift software engineering to the next level to where perhaps softwares are able to create new softwares in a matter of minutes. </p>
       							<p class="intro">The future also lies in the basic programming skills that people possess. In the future, pretty much everybody will be familiar with some sort of programming whether that be excel sheets or complicated python programs. Software engineering will reach a level where dreams such as self-driving vehicles will be made possible due to the advancement in the field especially from the vision and graphics aid. </p>       							
       							<p class="intro">In terms of software engineering as a career, the field seems to be very promising especially because of the rise of automated systems. Due to this the number of programmers needed has been increasing and will continue to follow this pattern due to everything slowly becoming digitalised. Even money is becoming digitalised e.g. the invention of the bitcoin. Rapid inventions such as these result in more software engineers being needed in order to create the new softwares needed to allow for these new inventions to run.</p>
